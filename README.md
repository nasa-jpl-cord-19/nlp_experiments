This repository is dedicated to performing a variety of NLP experiments on the COVID-19 Kaggle dataset.
<br>
<br>
The <b>Geographic NER</b> iPython notebook is focused around extracting geographic locations (cities and countries) mentioned throughout the papers.
<br>
<br>
The notebook is split into the following sections:
1. Initial GeoTopicParser experiments.
2. GeoText extraction (<b>the actual location extraction</b>).
3. Weather extraction (from the extracted locations).
4. Text processing to determine the severity of incidents in the papers per mentioned locations (currently in progress).
<br>
All the resulting data is saved in the <b>geodata</b> folder.
